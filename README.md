There are three primary roulette layouts: American, European, and French. Each layout is different thus there are different probabilities for each bet for each layout.

The game is simple. Players choose a bet, once all players have chosen their bets the table will no longer accept anymore and the wheel will be spun. The result of the spin determines whether or not your bet hits.
